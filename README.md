# mLab-MongoDB - Activity 2 - Creating a Database and a Collection in MongoDB

- Install MongoDB and MongoDB Shell 
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your MongoDB database.
- On the terminal or command prompt type mongosh to start MongoDB
- On the terminal or command prompt, type the following command to create a new database, : use mydatabase
- Then we must create a collection , because in MongoDB for your database to visible you must have a collection
- On the terminal or command prompt, type the following command to create a new collection, : db.collectionName.insertOne({""})
- insertOne({}) - we are creating a collection and we are going to insert a document
- In each collection you are going to have a field that is going to represnt the data e.g db.Trainees.insertOne({name:Ashley})
- How to see the collections that you have created in your database, run the command show collections on the terminal or command promp to view the collections in your database.
